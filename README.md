### <span style="color: #868e96">A Developer You'd Want to Collaborate With</span>

---
Alooo !! 👋 I’m MalrangCow, a dedicated back-end developer with a zest for creativity and innovation. 😄

When I'm not deep in code, you'll find me riffing on my electric guitar 🎸, immersing myself in gaming 🎮,  
or taking leisurely drives accompanied by my favorite tunes. 🎧  
If any of these resonate with you, we're already friends! 👬

At [SSAFY] <img src="assets/Samsung.png" width="5%">, I've triumphantly wrapped up my first semester and am currently navigating through the second. 🏃

Each day in my software development voyage is energized by an unbridled enthusiasm for learning 🔥💪  
and a steadfast dedication to honing my craft with the latest technologies. 💻

[//]: # (I currently work at ~ as a ~. After ~ years in the “Software Engineering Development Program” - rotating from team to team to learn new technologies and meet other developers - I landed on the Authoring team, which develops our next-generation email campaign editor. I also run the “~” a group focused on improving and modernizing frontend technology for all our engineers.)

[//]: # (In 2014 I graduated from ~ with a B.S. in ~ Development. I studied ~, ~ ;mostly ~;, ~, ~, ~, and more. I also received a Minor in Music & Technology, a combination of music theory, history, culture, and audio engineering.)

[//]: # (Throughout university I was an active member of Computer Science House, a “Special Interest House” with a focus on, you guessed it, computers. I learned a ton while I was there, both through personal projects and just being in an atmosphere of learning and &#40;more importantly&#41; doing.)
